Note: This tool uses ZIP compresion, but does not use ZIP format.
Created archive can be read by any ZIP tool, but this tool can read only archives created by tools based on System.IO.Packaging.ZipPackage.
This tool is as stupid as System.IO.Packaging.ZipPackage, don't blame me. I simply needed lightweight packaking tool that can be used from command line and from code.       
When -sd or -sg is used only one file can be (un)compressed. Compressed file represents raw Deflate or GZip stream.
