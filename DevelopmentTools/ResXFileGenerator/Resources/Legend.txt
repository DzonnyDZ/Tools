Usage:
    {0} parameters
Parameters:
    /in <infile> - required, path of input resx file
    /out <outfile> - required, path of output file
    /lang <language> - optional, name of output lanuage. If not specified inferred form outfile extension
        supported values (case-insensitive) are: vb, cs, c, cpp, h, cpp.7, cpp.vs, js, java, jsl
        cpp.7 and cpp.vs are two alternative C++ providers
        c, cpp and h have same meaning (C++)
        java and jsl jave same meaning (J#)
    /nologo - optional, do not show version and copyright info
    /internal - optional, if specified internal (friend) class is generated; public otherwise
    /ns <namespace> - optional, namespace of class
    /name <resource_name> - optional, name of resource as it is embdeded to assembly.
        If ommitted inferred from infile name (likely incorrectly, so /name should be used always)
    /firstline <text> - optional, adds text to first line of generated file (in combination with /spliton works only on first part)
    /l <part> <line> <text> - optional, can be multiple times, inserts given text at given line
        part is a for first, b for second part of splitted file;  b is valid only when /spliton is used
    /spliton <text> - optional (required for /out2), splits text to two files on given string
        Escape sequences allowed: \\, \n, \r
        <text> goes to part b 
    /out2 <outfile> - optional (required for spliton), Same as /out, but for part b of source splitted by /spliton
/spliton and /out2 allows to split C++ output to *.h and *.cpp file     
Note: If value of argument contains space, it must be quoted.
